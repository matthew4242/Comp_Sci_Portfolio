This project was about classifying electrocardiogram recordings using machine learning algorithms. 

The two methods I used for the project was descision trees and artificial nueral networks. The final result achieved a 
82% accuracy using the decision tree method. 

The code used for this is inside the code folder and will require these libraries to run:

Python Version : 3.7.3 , Keras Version : 2.2.4 , Sklearn Version : 0.21.0 , TensorFlow Version: 1.13.1

To run the code you will also need to edit the file names to where you are holding the test and training data for 
the different methods. You will need to request the test and training data to run the code.

Inside the documents is the report that explains the research, design and implimentation stages of this project.
